                                <p>A UX redesign exercise to migrate the BikeNook site to the Shopify platform. The site was redesigned on Figma to have a more modern and cleaner layout while adhering to the product style guide. It was also designed to be device responsive. </p>
    
                                <h5>Outcome</h5>
                                <p>A couple of A/B tests were performed to test the new design on Shopify against the old version on Buyist. The results proved positive with an uptick towards the Shopify layout and site was eventually migrated. Soon after, the BikeNook Turbo (another product of the same line) site was developed with the same design DNA due to the success of the migration.</p>
